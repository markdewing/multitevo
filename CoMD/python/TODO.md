* Add EAM code (I have some initial code for this, but not checked-in)
* Add YAML output (particularly performance information), so output can be postprocessed using Mantevo tools
* Array accesses follow the C code in mapping 3D indices to single 1D array.   The code might be simplified by using multi-dimensional numpy arrays.
* See if code can be run under python-benchmarks framework, see here https://github.com/numfocus/python-benchmarks
