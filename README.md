Translation of Mantevo miniapps into other languages

The [Mantevo project](https://mantevo.org/) contains a number of miniapps to aid in analyzing application performance.   Another use for these miniapps is evaluating other computer languages for expressiveness, performance, etc.   The miniapps are a nice size that is bigger than a toy example, yet much simpler than a full application.

Directory layout is
* \<miniapp name>
  * \<language>
    * \<variant> (eg. parallel or serial, or different algorithms)
  
Currently, the only app is CoMD (molecular dynamics).
There are implementations in Python and Julia.
Find more information about the available variants in the [README](CoMD/README.md) in the CoMD direectory.
